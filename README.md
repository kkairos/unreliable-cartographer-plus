2020 Seven-Day Roguelike

See basics.txt for a very basic rundown and one big tip. (We recommend playing a couple of times before reading the big tip.)

Playable with python3 and libtcod.

It is believed we finished approximately 168 hours after coding. I started asking electro for deliverables on tiles around 11:30 AM Pacific Time last Saturday, and if I recall correctly didn't start coding properly on this till later. I don't recall exactly when all the alpha tiles were made (alpha tileset not included in latest version of repo.) We're uploading before 11:30 AM this Saturday.

Thanks to many folks but especially to:
* libtcod maintainers ("Jice and the libtcod contributors")
* HexDecimal (current maintainer)
* TStand90 for his tutorials and for working through the tutorial with the new console code, which saved my bacon when starting out again with libtcod.
