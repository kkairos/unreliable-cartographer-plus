The Unreliable Cartographer

By KKairos and ElectroManiacal, (c) 2020 to extent permitted by law

A game about navigating a trap-laden dungeon with an unreliable map.

7DRL 2020. Playable with:

* python3 and libtcod. (run uc-plus.py)
* Windows (32 and 64-bit available)

THIS VERSION has been modified to remove a bug and a sloppy printing matter, and does a tiny bit of rebalancing for more difficulty.

We're mostly happy with how this game came out, I think. It's not the fairest roguelike ever made, but I (Dan / KKairos) really think the central mechanic is workable enough.

--FROM 7DRL DESCRIPTION--

Previously incorporated code:

https://github.com/kkairos/unnamed-rl-base/tree/6a12fcfc54421040b8affd66129a07c7fc97202a

It is believed we finished approximately 168 hours after coding. I started asking electro for deliverables on tiles around 11:30 AM Pacific Time last Saturday, and if I recall correctly didn't start coding properly on this till later. I don't recall exactly when all the alpha tiles were made (alpha tileset not included in latest version of repo.) We're uploading before 11:30 AM this Saturday.

If you want a tip:

There's really only one tip:

Keep scrolling if you want this tip (I recommend not reading this till you've tried the game a couple of times. It might be obvious already but if not it could be a major spoiler.)

OK, here it is:

* Pay really close attention to the map glyphs and map tiles on floor one. That is the only time they're going to be 100% accurate to the map.
